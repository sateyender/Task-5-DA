# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the relationships between passenger attributes and survival probability.  
The analysis was conducted in Python using Google Colab with **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**.

## 📊 Key Insights
1. **Gender** – Females had a higher survival rate than males.
2. **Passenger Class** – 1st Class passengers had the highest survival rate.
3. **Age** – Younger passengers were slightly more likely to survive.
4. **Fare** – Higher fares were linked to higher survival chances.
5. **Missing Values** – 'Cabin' had many missing entries; 'Age' had some.
